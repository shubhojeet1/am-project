            Cybersecurity, short for "cybersecurity," is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and damage. As technology has become an integral part of our personal and professional lives, the need for robust cybersecurity measures has grown exponentially to safeguard sensitive information and critical infrastructure from potential threats.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Data Protection: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is crucial. This involves encryption, access controls, and secure storage to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
              </li>
              <li>
                Network Security: Protecting computer networks from intrusion, malware, and unauthorized access is vital. Network security measures include firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs)              </li>
              <li>
                Endpoint Security: Endpoints such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices are potential entry points for cyberattacks. Endpoint security solutions like antivirus software and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are used to secure these devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM involves managing user identities and their access to various resources. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies are examples of IAM practices
              </li>
              <li>
                Application Security: Ensuring that software and applications are free from vulnerabilities and protected against attacks. Regular security testing, code reviews, and secure coding practices are essential in application security.
              </li>
              <li>
                Incident Response: Having a well-defined incident response plan helps organizations respond effectively to cyber incidents, minimizing damage and downtime.
              </li>
              <li>
                Security Audits and Compliance: Regular security audits and compliance with relevant regulations help organizations identify vulnerabilities and ensure they meet security standards
              </li>
              <li>
                Security Awareness Training: Educating employees and users about cybersecurity best practices is essential as human error is often a significant factor in security breaches.
              </li>

          <h3>Common types of cyberattacks include:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Malware: Malicious software designed to harm or gain unauthorized access to systems, including viruses, ransomware, and trojans.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phishing: Attempting to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, through deceptive emails or websites.
            </li>
            <li>
              Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks: Overloading systems or networks to make them unavailable to legitimate users
            </li>
            <li>
              Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Intercepting and possibly altering communications between two parties without their knowledge
            </li>
            <li>
              SQL Injection: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access to databases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Zero-day Exploits: Exploiting undisclosed vulnerabilities before a patch or fix is available.
            </li>
            <li>
              Insider Threats: Threats that originate from within an organization, often involving employees or contractors with access to sensitive information.
