          <h2>About Cryptocurrencies</h2>
          <p>
            Security: Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. This security feature makes it challenging for hackers to manipulate the system or counterfeit digital currency.
            <br /><br />
            Anonymity and Transparency: While cryptocurrencies offer a level of privacy through the use of pseudonymous addresses, all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and traceability.
            <br /><br />
            Limited supply: Most cryptocurrencies have a finite supply, which means there is a maximum number of coins or tokens that can ever be created. This scarcity can contribute to their value over time.
            <br /><br />
            Bitcoin (BTC): Created in 2009, Bitcoin was the first and remains the most well-known cryptocurrency. It serves as a store of value and a medium of exchange
            <br /><br />
            Ethereum (ETH): Launched in 2015, Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
            <br /><br />
            Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), and many others are examples of cryptocurrencies that aim to provide unique features and capabilities beyond simple currency use.Ltecoin (LTC): Introduced in 2011, Litecoin is often referred to as the "silver to Bitcoin's gold." It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but with some differences.
