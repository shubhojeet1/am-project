            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. It involves the study of algorithms and statistical models that computers use to perform a task or make predictions based on patterns and data.

                Training Data: Machine learning algorithms require training data, which consists of examples or instances with known outcomes. The algorithm learns from this data to identify patterns and relationships.

                Feature Extraction: Features are specific characteristics or attributes of the data that are used as input to the machine learning algorithm. The process of selecting and extracting relevant features is essential for the algorithm's performance.

                Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with labeled training data, meaning each example in the dataset is associated with a known output or label. The algorithm learns to map inputs to the correct outputs based on the provided labels.
