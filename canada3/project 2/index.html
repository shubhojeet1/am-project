          <p>Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central authority, like a government or financial institution. It leverages blockchain technology to achieve decentralization, transparency, and immutability.

                Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies, which are controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network of computers, known as nodes. This distributed nature makes them less susceptible to control or manipulation by any single entity.

                Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a group of transactions, and once added to the blockchain, it becomes difficult to alter, ensuring transaction security and transparency.
