          <h2>More About Canada</h2>
          <p>
            Canada is a vast and diverse country located in North America. It is the second-largest country in the world by land area, covering approximately 9.98 million square kilometers (3.85 million square miles). As of my last update in September 2021, here are some key aspects of Canada:
            <br /><br />

            Geography: Canada is known for its breathtaking natural beauty, including vast forests, majestic mountains, numerous lakes, and extensive coastlines. It shares borders with the United States to the south and is surrounded by the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. The country is divided into ten provinces and three territories.

            <br /><br />
            Population: As of 2021, Canada had a population of over 38 million people. The country has a relatively low population density due to its vast landmass.
            <br /><br />
            Official Languages: Canada has two official languages: English and French. This duality reflects the country's history as a former French and British colony.
            <br /><br />
            Government: Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy. The British monarch is the head of state, represented by the Governor General of Canada. The Prime Minister is the head of government and is responsible for the day-to-day administration.
            <br /><br />

Key industries include manufacturing, technology, finance, and services. Canada has strong trade ties with the United States and other countries around the world.
            <br /><br />
            Health Care and Social Services: Canada has a publicly funded healthcare system that provides essential medical services to all citizens and permanent residents. It is administered at the provincial and territorial levels, resulting in some variations in coverage across the country.
            <br /><br />
            Education: Canada has a well-developed education system, with public education provided to all Canadian citizens and permanent residents up to the secondary level. The country is also home to several prestigious universities and colleges Multiculturalism: Canada is known for its commitment to multiculturalism and diversity.

            <br /><br />
