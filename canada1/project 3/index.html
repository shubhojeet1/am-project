            Canada’s national winter sport and most Canadians feel the same way about hockey as the British do about football; it’s almost a matter of life or death. It is thought the first game was played in Montreal back in the 1870s and since 1893, the pinnacle is winning the Stanley Cup. It’s the oldest sports’ trophy in North America – named after Lord Stanley of Preston – and is now the championship trophy awarded to the playoff winner in the National Hockey League.
